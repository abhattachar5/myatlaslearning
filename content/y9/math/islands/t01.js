Object.assign(LESSONS, {
  "m9i-01-1": `<h2>Simplifying Surds</h2>
<p>A <strong>surd</strong> is a root that does not work out to a whole number, like √2 or √5. We leave surds in root form because their decimals never end and never repeat.</p>
<p>To <strong>simplify</strong> a surd, look for the <strong>largest square factor</strong> of the number under the root (4, 9, 16, 25, 36, …), then split the root into two.</p>
<h3>Worked example</h3>
<p>Simplify √72.</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest square factor of 72 is 36, because 72 = 36 × 2.</li>
<li>√72 = √36 × √2 = 6√2.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common mistake</h3>
<p>Taking out a square factor that is <em>not</em> the largest leaves more work to do. √72 = √(4 × 18) = 2√18 is correct but not finished, because √18 still simplifies. Always take the largest square factor in one step.</p>`,

  "m9i-01-2": `<h2>Adding &amp; Subtracting Surds</h2>
<p>You can only add or subtract surds when the number under the root is the <strong>same</strong> — these are called <strong>like surds</strong>. Treat √2 like a unit (similar to collecting like terms in algebra).</p>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> a√c + b√c = (a + b)√c. Add or subtract the numbers in front; the surd stays the same.</p>
<h3>Worked example</h3>
<p>Work out √50 − √18.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplify each surd first: √50 = 5√2 and √18 = 3√2.</li>
<li>Now they are like surds: 5√2 − 3√2 = 2√2.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common mistake</h3>
<p>√50 − √18 is <em>not</em> √(50 − 18) = √32. You cannot add or subtract the numbers under the roots — you must simplify and collect like surds.</p>`,

  "m9i-01-3": `<h2>Multiplying &amp; Dividing Surds</h2>
<p>Two simple rules do all the work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product rule:</strong> √a × √b = √(ab)</li>
<li><strong>Quotient rule:</strong> √a ÷ √b = √(a/b)</li>
</ul>
<p>When there are numbers in front (coefficients), multiply the coefficients together and the surds together separately.</p>
<h3>Worked example</h3>
<p>Work out 2√3 × 5√2.</p>
<ul>
<li>Coefficients: 2 × 5 = 10.</li>
<li>Surds: √3 × √2 = √6.</li>
<li>Answer: 10√6.</li>
</ul>
<p>A useful special case: (√a)² = √a × √a = a. For example (√7)² = 7.</p>
<h3>Common mistake</h3>
<p>Always simplify the final surd. √6 × √8 = √48, and √48 = 4√3 — leaving it as √48 is not fully simplified.</p>`,

  "m9i-01-4": `<h2>Rationalising the Denominator</h2>
<p>A fraction with a surd on the bottom, like 1/√2, is not in standard form. <strong>Rationalising</strong> means rewriting it so the denominator is a rational number.</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> multiply the top and bottom by the surd in the denominator. This works because √b × √b = b, which is rational, and multiplying top and bottom by the same thing does not change the value.</p>
<h3>Worked example</h3>
<p>Rationalise and simplify 6/√3.</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiply top and bottom by √3: (6 × √3)/(√3 × √3) = 6√3/3.</li>
<li>Simplify: 6 ÷ 3 = 2, so the answer is 2√3.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common mistake</h3>
<p>Don't forget the final simplify step. 6√3/3 is correct but not finished — the 6 and 3 cancel to give 2√3.</p>`
